## Can we generate weather data for future dates?
So here is an interesting idea I stumbled into, can we visualize and use “Future Weather Data”? As it is we currently use weather data collected from the past to design buildings that will be built and function into the future. It is implied that weather (long-range view) is constant which it is not, so, could we get to a point where we are able to design to predicted weather conditions, or even still, should we? For a given scenario let’s say we design and certify a Passive House in Illinois, but then in 50 years if the weather in Illinois changed as drastic as some people predict, is it still a Passive House? At any rate it is out there. There are many obstacles along the way starting with the logic of ‘predicted long range climate’ What do you think? Obviously I think it is a worthwhile discussion.
