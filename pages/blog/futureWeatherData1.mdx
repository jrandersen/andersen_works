## Can we generate weather data for future dates?
So, an interesting question was posed to me when I was traning USACE Army Corp of Engineers personel; "Can we visualize and use *Future Weather Data* ? 

As standard practice, architects and engineers use weather data collected from the past to design buildings that will be built and function well into the future. It is implied that weather (a short-range view) is constant which it is not, hence climate-change. Therefore a question proposed, could we get to a point where we are able to design to predicted weather conditions, or even still, should we? 

For a given scenario let’s say we design and certify a Passive House in Illinois, but then in 50 years if the weather in Illinois changes as drastic as some people predict, is it still a Passive House? At any rate, thsi is a topic we need to discuss in our discipline. There are many obstacles along the way starting with the logic of ‘predicted long range climate’ What do you think? Obviously I think it is a worthwhile discussion.
