# Work Project: Airtable Sync 2021
My role lies at the intersection of computational design, full-stack software development & product owner. I will often act as an application engineer to create an MVP to flush out the use case.

Technologies used: pyRevit, IronPython, NoCodeApi

### background
We used airtable to do POC's and for working though the build-up of information from Proposal -> Models -> Workorders.

Once that was all laid out we used multiple airtable bases to house different levels of information from models and combine it with other data sets like standard pricing, or standard site delivery items.
