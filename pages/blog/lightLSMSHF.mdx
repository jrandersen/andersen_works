## Light boxes for Lousinana sport museum & sports hall of fame
This is a video taken over a couple days when I was building the Lights for the Trahan project we did at Case. Digital Project is quite a program and if you ever have a chance to use it to its full extent, take it! They had to conform to the back of all the panels and not hit ME or P in the process. While not really a tutorial on teh use of DP and Knowledeg Templates it does go through a good parametric process to achieve precise outcomes.
