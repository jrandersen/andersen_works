# Work Project: CASE-INC Commonwealth Design Museum 2011 - 2012
With a clear objective to use BIM to eliminate process friction in information exchange across parties and project phases, the Owner of this 250,000 sf. mixed-use development directed the team to prepare a model-based approach that would eventually be used in the facilityâ€™s operation. CASE was engaged to lead as Project BIM Manager throughout the Design phase. Our role was to eliminate any process friction introduced by the new technologies, supporting the disparate teams in their objective to meet project deliverables.
