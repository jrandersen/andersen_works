## A New Data Frontier in AEC

As the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operations (AECO) industry continues to evolve, the potential for a new approach to data standardization, inspired by the successful model of browser standardization, looms large. This article postulates a way forward for AECO data standardization, drawing parallels with the web stack's journey and envisioning what a 'web stack for Building Information Modeling (BIM)' could look like.
How Browser Standardization Paved the Way for Today's Digital Experience
In the annals of internet history, the evolution from static web pages to the interactive, integrated digital landscapes we navigate today marks a pivotal epoch. Central to this transformation has been the standardization of web browsers. This article delves into how this process not only streamlined web development but also catapulted the internet into a new era of innovation and user engagement.

The Fragmented Early Web to a Unified Vision
The 1990s witnessed the birth of the internet, but it was a disjointed world. Early browsers like Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer had their own rules for rendering web pages, creating a development nightmare. This era, described by Zeldman (2009) in "Designing With Web Standards," was marked by the need for developers to create multiple versions of the same website for different browsers, hindering the web's potential. The turning point came with the formation of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1994, which Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, described as crucial for the web's future. W3C's mission, as outlined in "Weaving the Web" (Berners-Lee, 1999), was to create common protocols that promote its evolution and ensure its interoperability. This move towards standardization marked the beginning of a new era for web development.

The Ripple Effects of Browser Standardization
    - Developer Empowerment and Efficiency: As noted by Flanagan (2006) in "JavaScript: The Definitive Guide," standardization simplified the development process, enabling developers to write code that worked uniformly across different browsers. This efficiency unlocked new potential for creativity and innovation in web design.
    - Enhanced User Experience: Standardization led to a more consistent and reliable user experience. Users no longer had to contend with broken layouts or non-functional features when switching browsers, as highlighted by McFarland (2015) in "JavaScript & jQuery: The Missing Manual."
    - The Birth of Modern Web Applications: With a standardized platform, technologies like AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) gained prominence, as discussed in Garrett's seminal essay "Ajax: A New Approach to Web Applications" (2005). This enabled the creation of complex, dynamic web applications, transcending the limitations of the early static web.
    - Fostering Innovation and Competition: Standardization leveled the playing field for browser developers, fostering healthy competition and innovation. Browsers focused on speed, security, and feature enhancements, benefiting end-users and developers alike.

Browser standardization was more than a technical milestone; it was a catalyst that transformed the internet into a dynamic, interactive platform. It paved the way for the rich, user-centric web experiences we enjoy today, and set the stage for continuous innovation in the digital realm.
