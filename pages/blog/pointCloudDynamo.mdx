# Point Clouds in Dynamo
One of the really nice things about Dynamo is the relative ease with which we can integrate formerly separate entities. I am starting to use this platform to weave [Revit/ReCaps](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/10/point-cloud-indexing-update.html) point cloud methods with other useful attributes of open source point cloud processing like the PCL [Point Cloud Library](https://pointclouds.org/) This is a really exciting time!

So here are some first forays. Importing RCS files, current just RCS but it appears we will be able to import all known file types and actually be able to construct our own import with the [PointCloud Client](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/revit/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2014/ENU/Revit/files/GUID-B80DBCF1-56A8-4864-A0CD-181466E0EDE8-htm.html)
