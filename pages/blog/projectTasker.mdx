# Side Project: +Tasker
As part of my Software Fellowship I individually executed a week long capstone project for a full-stack application. This app allows a user to track Tasks on Projects with the ability to add Time, the app also reports total time per project and individual. 

Technologies used: Django, Postgres, Bulma
