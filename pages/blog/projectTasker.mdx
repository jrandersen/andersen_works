# Software Fellowship: +Tasker
As part of my fellowship as a capstone project I individually designed & executed a week long full-stack application. This app allows a user to track Tasks on Projects with the ability to add Time, the app also reports total time per project and individual. 

### The Brief
A task app that is solely meant for a userâ€™s daily tasks. Or in another persepctive "Your daily tasks rollover if not completed".  In this iteration I will implement: <br>
- user Auth
user Profile. 
account signup/login/logout. 
a the main page to input Tasks (full crud). 
Tasks 
add Task to Projects (full crud) 
add Notes (full crud)
Add Time 
add Tags to time (full crud)

As a stretch goal, I would like to make roll-up functions in the project and profile models to graph time. In addition as a stretch, I would like to add google login.


 ### Technologies used:
 Django
 Postgre
 Bulma
 Django-Taggit
