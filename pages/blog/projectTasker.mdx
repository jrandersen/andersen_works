# Software Fellowship: General Assembly - Fall 2020

## Project +Tasker
As part of my fellowship as a capstone project I individually designed & executed a week long full-stack application. This app allows a user to track Tasks on Projects with the ability to add Time, the app also reports total time per project and individual.
